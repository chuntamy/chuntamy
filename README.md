I'm current studying in University of Melbourne.
My professional journey bridges the gap between data science, healthcare, and human behaviour, build on my undergraduate degree in Clinical Psychology and Statistics. With a strong academic foundation in different backgrounds, enabling me to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets that drive strategic decisions.
